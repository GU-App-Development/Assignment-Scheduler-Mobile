## Assignment Scheduler

### What the project does
This is an android app that allows users to organize the assignments, quizzes, and exams that need  
to be completed for each class added in the app. It also has a way for users to add the assignments  
to their personal google calendar.

### Why the project is useful
With students in mind, this app will, hopefully, streamline the process for organize what a student  
needs to complete on a daily basis. It does this by separating tasks that are included in traditional  
scheduler apps.

### How users can get started with the project
During development, this app can be cloned and installed onto an android device using Android Studio.  
After installation, one should be able to navigate through the different activities involved with this app  
and to navigate to the Google Calendar on a device that utilizes google.
